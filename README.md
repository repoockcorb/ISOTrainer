# ISOTrainer ðŸ’ª
ISOTrainer is a graphical user interface (GUI) written in python designed for displaying live weight from 2 channel inputs on a [PhidgetBridge 4-Input](https://www.phidgets.com/?prodid=1027) device.   

The interface outputs the readings at a 5Hz interval. The data is logged to a CSV file within a folder called '_ISOTrainer-Logs_' located in the `ISOTrainer.exe` root directory. This folder will be created on the first time the program logs any data.

The program was designed for a study into Isometric Training which is a type of exercise that involves contracting a muscle or group of muscles without moving a joint.

There is an `auto_exe_builder.py` file that allows you to compile and build the executable to run on machines that don't have python installed. This uses the pyinstaller python library.
